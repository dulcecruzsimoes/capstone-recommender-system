# KNN Model for Recommender System

## Overview

This document provides a detailed explanation of the implementation, evaluation, and results of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model for the recommendation system using the Retailrocket dataset.

## Detailed Explanation of Dataset Reduction, Splitting, and Evaluation Process

### Dataset Reduction for Performance

Given the large size of the original dataset, it was necessary to reduce its size to improve computational performance. We sampled a subset of 10,000 interactions from the original dataset. This reduction allows us to test and refine our recommendation model more efficiently. The reduced dataset retains the characteristics of the original dataset but is small enough to allow for quicker iterations during model development and evaluation.

### Splitting Data into Training and Test Sets

To evaluate the recommendation model effectively, we divided the reduced dataset into training and test sets based on a temporal split. This approach ensures that we evaluate the model on future interactions, simulating a real-world scenario where we predict future user behavior based on past interactions.

### Evaluation Methodology

#### User-Item Interaction Matrix

We transformed the training and test datasets into user-item interaction matrices. These matrices represent users' interactions with items, where rows correspond to users, columns correspond to items, and cell values indicate the number of interactions.

#### KNN Recommendation Model

We used the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to recommend items to users. The KNN model was trained using the training set's interaction matrix. Note that KNN does not perform traditional training; instead, it stores the training data and makes predictions based on the nearest neighbors at the time of the query.

#### Evaluation Process

We evaluated the model's performance using precision, recall, and the number of hits. These metrics provide insights into how well the model recommends relevant items to users.

1. **Precision@K:** The fraction of recommended items that are relevant.
2. **Recall@K:** The fraction of relevant items that are recommended.
3. **Hits@K:** The total number of relevant items recommended across all users.

## Results

The model that achieved the best results was the KNN model with the following performance metrics:
- **Precision@5:** 54.61%
- **Recall@5:** 56.97%
- **Hits@5:** 237

### Acceptability of Results

These results are considered acceptable for a recommendation system. The Precision@5 and Recall@5 values indicate that the model is reasonably good at recommending relevant items to users, making it a useful tool for improving user engagement and satisfaction.

### Reasons for KNN Performance

KNN performed the best due to its simplicity and effectiveness in capturing the similarity between users and items based on historical interaction data. It leverages the local neighborhood information, which is particularly useful in sparse datasets like Retailrocket.

## Future Improvements

To improve the model further, we could explore:
- **Tuning the hyperparameters**: Optimizing the number of neighbors (K) and distance metrics.
- **Incorporating more features**: Including additional user and item features to capture more information.
- **Hybrid Models**: Combining KNN with other models like matrix factorization or neural networks to leverage the strengths of different algorithms.
