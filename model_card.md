# KNN Model Card

## Model Overview

**Model Name:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Recommender System

**Model Description:** 
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model is a collaborative filtering algorithm used for the recommendation system. It recommends items to users based on the items that similar users have interacted with. The model computes the similarity between users and uses this similarity to make recommendations.

**Model Version:** 1.0

## Dataset

**Dataset Name:** Retailrocket Dataset (from Kaggle)

**Dataset Description:** 
The Retailrocket dataset contains anonymized interaction data from an e-commerce website. It includes three main files:
- `events.csv`: Contains the interactions (views, add-to-cart, transactions) between users and items.

The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/retailrocket/ecommerce-dataset).

**Dataset Reduction:**
To enhance computational performance, a subset of 10,000 interactions was sampled from the original dataset. This reduced dataset maintains the characteristics of the original data while allowing for faster iterations during model development and evaluation.

## Data Splitting

**Splitting Method:**
The data was split temporally to simulate a real-world scenario. The interactions before a specific split date were used for training, and interactions on or after the split date were used for testing. The split date was chosen to ensure that 80% of the data was used for training and 20% for testing.

**Split Date:** August 18, 2015

**Training Set:** Interactions before the split date.

**Test Set:** Interactions on or after the split date, ensuring all users in the test set also exist in the training set.

## Model Details

**Model Type:** Collaborative Filtering

**Algorithm:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

**Similarity Metric:** Cosine Similarity

**Hyperparameters:**
- Number of Neighbors (K): 5

**Training Details:**
The KNN model does not perform traditional training. Instead, it stores the training data and computes similarities at the time of making predictions. The training set was transformed into a user-item interaction matrix, where rows represent users, columns represent items, and cell values indicate interactions.

## Evaluation

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- **Precision@5:** The fraction of recommended items that are relevant.
- **Recall@5:** The fraction of relevant items that are recommended.
- **Hits@5:** The total number of relevant items recommended across all users.

**Evaluation Results:**
- **Precision@5:** 54.61%
- **Recall@5:** 56.97%
- **Hits@5:** 237

**Acceptability of Results:**
These results are considered acceptable for a recommendation system. The Precision@5 and Recall@5 values indicate that the model is reasonably good at recommending relevant items to users, making it a useful tool for improving user engagement and satisfaction.

## Future Improvements

To improve the model further, consider:
- **Tuning Hyperparameters:** Optimizing the number of neighbors (K) and distance metrics.
- **Incorporating More Features:** Including additional user and item features to capture more information.
- **Hybrid Models:** Combining KNN with other models like matrix factorization or neural networks to leverage the strengths of different algorithms.

## Ethical Considerations

- **Bias:** Ensure that the recommendation system does not reinforce existing biases in the data.
- **Privacy:** Maintain the privacy and anonymity of users by handling data responsibly.
- **Fairness:** Ensure that recommendations are fair and do not disproportionately favor certain items or users.

## Conclusion

The KNN model for the Retailrocket dataset provides a solid baseline for recommending items based on user interactions. With acceptable precision and recall metrics, it offers a reliable recommendation system that can be further improved with additional features and model enhancements.
