# Model Card for Recommender System

## Model Details

- **Model Type**: Recommender System
- **Algorithms Used**: Nearest Neighbor Methods, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks
- **Dataset**: Retailrocket dataset
- **Evaluation Metric**: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) with k-fold cross-validation

## Performance

### Nearest Neighbor Methods

- **Average RMSE**: [Insert RMSE value]

### Logistic Regression

- **Average RMSE**: [Insert RMSE value]

### Neural Networks

- **Average RMSE**: [Insert RMSE value]

### Optimized Logistic Regression

- **Average RMSE**: [Insert RMSE value after optimization]

## Dataset

The dataset consists of user interactions with items, item properties, and a category tree, which are used to build the user-item interaction matrix.

## Preprocessing

- **Data Imputation**: Missing values are filled with 0.
- **Data Transformation**: User-item interaction matrix created from the events data.

## Training and Evaluation

- **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: Used to evaluate the models' performance.
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Used to optimize the hyperparameters of the Logistic Regression model.

## Conclusion

This recommender system provides a robust solution for predicting user preferences and recommending products. The use of k-fold cross-validation ensures reliable performance evaluation, and Bayesian optimization helps in fine-tuning the model for better accuracy.
